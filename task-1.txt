✨ Task 1: A Confident Kickstart! | Apex Internship ✨
🚀 Internship Program: Web Development (PHP & MySQL)
🏢 Organization: ApexPlanet Software Pvt. Ltd.
🗓️ Duration: 45 Days
📍 Task 1: Setting Up the Development Environment

🔧 I’ve always believed a strong foundation leads to smoother builds. As someone already familiar with XAMPP, PHP, MySQL, Git & GitHub, Task-1 was a refreshing revisit of my early days in web development.

✔️ Installed and configured XAMPP
✔️ Created a PHP project under htdocs
✔️ Verified Apache & MySQL with test DB
✔️ Pushed the working setup to GitHub
✔️ Recorded and documented the task submission

This task wasn’t just setup—it was a statement:
✅ "I’ve done this before, and I’ll do it even better now!"
